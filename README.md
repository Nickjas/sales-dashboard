## Sales Dashboard 
This is an example which covers the basics of any sales dashboard. We did our best to make it visually appealing and easy to grasp.

Example contains four tabs: The first tab - is a general view - it allows to assess the situation as a whole, the other three tabs intend to reveal the situation for particular categories of products, sales team advances and evaluation of sales by region.
